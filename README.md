# variational-quantum-dynamics
This is a variational quantum algorithm (VQA) for simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics in the condensed phase environment. We integrate the [Adam optimization algorithm](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6980) as the classical optimizer for the parameterized quantum circuit in order to minimize a cost function, where the model Hamiltonian is that of a quantum system that is linearly coupled to a harmonic bath. The parameters to be updated are rotation angles, which are first solved for numerically using Runge-Kutta 8, and then subsequently with the VQA. The data contains the appropriate probability amplitudes.

The following files are included in this repository:

- VQD_MPI.py
    - This is a program which is scaled for use on a computer cluster or supercomputer using MPI. The output produced is in the form of .csv files, which can be plotted using one of the other files included, VQD_MPI_Plotter.py

- VQD.py
    - This is an old version of the program without MPI integration and intended for local use. The output produced by this file is a plot generated using Matplotlib.

- VQD_MPI_Plotter.py
    - This Python script will plot the output of VQD_MPI.py, given that the user updates the .csv file names in the script appropriately. 

- VQD_MPI_Plot_Example.png and VQD_Plot_Example.png
    - These are sample plots generated by each of the files listed above.
